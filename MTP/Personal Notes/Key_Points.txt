 1. Fully homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that allows the processing of data in encrypted form and is likely to have major applications in cloud security. However, significant efficiency improvements are needed before we can hope to put it to practical use.
 
 2.In recent years, we have been entrusting more and more of our electronic data to the cloud, including e-mail, internal company documents, and personal information. Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of that data is a major challenge for todayâ€™s security researchers and practitioners. A 2013 study by the Cloud Security Alliance revealed a worrying increase in the number of major data breach incidents in which cloud data was leaked as a result of negligence, malware, or insider attacks [1]. Cryptographers have proposed several possible approaches to addressing the problem of cloud security without compromising on functionality. One of the most promising approaches is fully homomorphic encryption, which has garnered a lot of attention in recent years.
 
 3.Homomorphic encryption is a fascinating and powerful technique that allows you to perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This can have many applications in fields like cloud computing, machine learning, healthcare, and finance, where you want to protect the privacy and security of your data while still benefiting from the services of third parties.

4.Homomorphic encryption is based on the idea that some mathematical operations can be performed on encrypted data in such a way that the result is the same as if they were performed on the original data. For example, if you add two encrypted numbers, you get the same result as if you added the plain numbers and then encrypted them. This property is called homomorphism, and it can be applied to different kinds of operations, such as addition, multiplication, or even more complex functions. The concept of homomorphic encryption was first proposed by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos in 1978, but it took decades to develop practical and efficient schemes that could support more than one operation.

5.FHE is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that enables third parties to process information without revealing the data itself by running computations on encrypted data.
This technology can have far-reaching implications for secure data analytics. Requests to a databank can be answered without accessing its plain text data, as the analysis is conducted on data that remains encrypted. This adds a third layer of security for data when in use, along with protecting data at rest and in transit.

6.As use cases for FHE seem rather straightforward, applications are of high interest to financial services, health care, government and wider industry stakeholders. Examples include secure cloud computing, manufacturing, secure analytics, privacy-preserving machine learning, secure communication, data outsourcing and processing, and secure search. In addition, FHE schemes are believed to be quantum resistant and protect against quantum computing attacks.

7.Importance of FHE for privacy pros-
FHE has the potential to revolutionize data security and privacy across industries. The increasing international developments and political support for PETs show they are no longer confined to academic research and will soon enter the mainstream. With impending standardization and hardware solutions, various application domains are expected to advance rapidly. Being aware of the latest developments and having a cryptographer on a privacy engineering team can help prepare for upcoming developments, make informed decisions and advocate for the responsible use of AI with available emerging PETs.

Intro - Cloud computing and cloud storage have contributed to a big shift in data processing and its use. With this cloud computing revolution, outsourcing applications are in great demand. The client uses the service by uploading their data to the cloud and finally gets the result by processing it. It benefits users greatly, but it also exposes sensitive data to third-party service providers.In recent years, we have been entrusting more and more of our electronic data to the cloud, including e-mail, internal company documents, and personal information. Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of that data is a major challenge. A 2013 study by the Cloud Security Alliance revealed a worrying increase in the number of major data breach incidents in which cloud data was leaked as a result of negligence, malware, or insider attacks.  Security is the key concern in cloud computing. Data provided to third-party service providers for processing and automation are a big issue.  Although data are encrypted, the difficulty with encrypted data is that it must be decrypted before being used. As a result of decrypting, it becomes vulnerable to all the things that we were trying to secure it from. Every single business or organization wishes for the personal and sensitive data of the user. Every organization whether government, private, healthcare, academia requires data for policy formation, research purposes, planning new marketing strategies, or launching innovative products.There exists no system to enable processing in the cloud with privacy. FHE permits computation on encrypted data in the cloud.Privacy of data is essential than ever before in this internet world.


 According to Statista, the top cloud security concerns are data loss and leakage (69%), and data privacy/confidentiality (66%), followed by accidental exposure of credentials (44%).
